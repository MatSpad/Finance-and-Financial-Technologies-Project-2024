This provision is coherent with the American approach of encouragement towards entrepreneurship and growth, somehow limiting creditors' safety.\n","\n","On the other hand, a situation similar to BKNG's one would not be verifiable in Italy, as the Corporate Law requires LLCs (i.e., S.r.l- and S.p.A-type firms) to maintain a minimum amount of Equity. Any company missing to satisfy this requirement might be restored through financial measures (e.g., capital injection) or potentially face liquidation proceedings. In fact, the Italian Civil Code - traditionally emphasizing  creditor protection - aims to maintain financial stability even by forcing firms to take corrective actions rather than allowing financial distress indicated by negative Equity."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"FqVgLeCXROlC"},"source":["## Stock Price Estimation\n","We estimate the Stock Price by two methods:\n","\n","1) Projected Free Cash Flows system;\n","\n","2) Discounted Cash Flow Perpetuity model."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"k5cHOc37OCFs","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1714075775167,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":465,"user":{"displayName":"Matteo Spadaccia","userId":"07886475442363014775"}},"outputId":"718d83fb-4bf7-4ea0-c5ee-49a3c4bedddf"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Operating Margin: 27.31 %\n","Capex Percentage of Revenue: -1.61 %\n","Change in NWC Percentage of Revenue: -23.76 %\n","Future-CFs-estimated Stock Price = 3210.61$\n"]}],"source":["# 1) Projected Free Cash Flows\n","\n","# Calculating financial metrics\n","revenue = financials.loc['Total Revenue'].iloc[0]\n","operating_income = financials.loc['Operating Income'].iloc[0]\n","capex = cashflow.loc['Capital Expenditure'].iloc[0]\n","nwc = balance_sheet.loc['Current Assets'] - balance_sheet.loc['Current Liabilities']\n","operating_margin = (operating_income / revenue) * 100\n","capex_percentage_of_revenue = (capex / revenue) * 100\n","change_in_nwc_percentage_of_revenue = ((nwc.iloc[0] - nwc.iloc[-1]) / revenue) * 100\n","print(\"Operating Margin:\", round(operating_margin, 2), \"%\")\n","print(\"Capex Percentage of Revenue:\", round(capex_percentage_of_revenue, 2), \"%\")\n","print(\"Change in NWC Percentage of Revenue:\", round(change_in_nwc_percentage_of_revenue, 2), \"%\")\n","\n","# Calculating the revenue growth and prediciting the future revenue (with gradual decrease of g to 6%)\n","revenue_growth = financials.loc['Total Revenue'].iloc[::-1].pct_change()\n","revenue_growth.dropna(inplace=True)\n","last_known_growth = revenue_growth.iloc[-1]\n","future_years = 6  # Number of future years to predict\n","final_growth_rate = 0.06  # Target final growth rate\n","\n","# Creating a linear interpolation between the last known growth and the final target growth\n","predicted_growth = np.linspace(last_known_growth, final_growth_rate, future_years)\n","\n","# Projecting future revenues\n","current_revenue = financials.loc['Total Revenue'].iloc[0]  # Revenue current year\n","projected_revenues = []\n","for i in range(0,6):\n","    future_revenue = current_revenue * ((1 + predicted_growth[i]) ** i)\n","    projected_revenues.append(future_revenue)\n","\n","# Projecting future free cash flows\n","free_cash_flows = []\n","for revenue in projected_revenues:\n","    operating_income = revenue * operating_margin\n","    capex = revenue * capex_percentage_of_revenue\n","    change_in_nwc = revenue * change_in_nwc_percentage_of_revenue\n","    free_cash_flow = operating_income + capex + change_in_nwc\n","    free_cash_flows.append(free_cash_flow)\n","\n","# Estimating the stock price\n","weighted_avg_cost_of_capital = 0.12 # Obtained from future calculations for the WACC\n","debt = balance_sheet.loc['Long Term Debt'].iloc[0]\n","present_value_flows = sum(cf / ((1 + weighted_avg_cost_of_capital) ** (i+1)) for i, cf in enumerate(free_cash_flows))\n","shares_outstanding = balance_sheet.loc['Share Issued'].iloc[0]  # Assuming outstanding shares\n","stock_price = (present_value_flows - debt) / shares_outstanding\n","stock_price = stock_price.mean()\n","print(f\"Future-CFs-estimated Stock Price = {stock_price:.2f}$\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Using the projected future Free Cash Flows system, we build a Stock Price estimation which highly relies on the future Revenue Growth assessment.
